## Project Description
Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The most important risk factor for HCC diagnosis is cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis arises as a result of long-lasting damage cause to the liver due to the building up of scar tissue. Several factors have been identified of being the main cause behind cirrhosis, including viral hepatitis B and C (HepBand HepC), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholicfatty liver disease (NAFLD). Longitudinal measurements of biomarker levels, age, gender, aetiologies and cancer status were obtained from patients undegoing screening from 2009 and 2017 in the South East region of Scotland. This report focused on analysing longitudinal healtcare data and describe several  statistical methodologies to estimate the survival rate of patient afected by liver cancer. 

Our goal in this report was to: 
+ find a better strategy of the use of serial biomarker for
early detection of HCC 
+ identify strata of patient that are more vulnerable to HCC development. 
+ Analyse if the gender bias stays the same for patients with different aetiologies. 

Ultimately, the project will aim to:
+ present a valid framework in assessing patient's risk of HCC diagnosis using personalised screening test. 
+ developed a framework that will aim at constantly update the prediction of the patient's survival probabilities. 

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://github.com/ErRos2107/Consultancy-Project-1/tree/master/Data) within this repo.    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/ErRos2107/Consultancy-Project-1/tree/master/Codes).

 *The raw data `Screening_cohort.xlsx` and `HCC_in_screening.xlsx` were initially cleaned in Excel and then cleaned using the R codes in`Preparing_data.R`. The data used in the report are located in the`Full_data_final.xlsx` spreadsheet.* 

6. Install R packages.

*The set up of the project is straightforward (ie. requires installation of some R packages)*
