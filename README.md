## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://github.com/ErRos2107/Consultancy-Project-1/tree/master/Data) within this repo.

   
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/ErRos2107/Consultancy-Project-1/tree/master/Codes).

 *The raw data `Screening_cohort.xlsx` and `HCC_in_screening.xlsx` were initially cleaned in Excel and then cleaned using the R codes in`Preparing_data.R`. The data file used in the report are located in `Full_data_final.xlsx`*

*The set up of the project is straightforward (ie. requires installation of some packages)*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
