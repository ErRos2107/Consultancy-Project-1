abstract = {"Preface Joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data have become a valuable tool in the analysis of follow-up data. These models are applicable mainly in two settings: First, when focus is in the survival outcome and we wish to account for the effect of an endogenous time-dependent covariate measured with error, and second, when focus is in the longitudinal outcome and we wish to correct for nonrandom dropout. Due to their capability to provide valid inferences in settings where simpler statistical tools fail to do so, and their wide range of applications, the last 25 years have seen many advances in the joint modeling field. Even though interest and developments in joint models have been widespread, information about them has been equally scattered in articles, presenting recent advances in the field, and in book chapters in a few texts dedicated either to longitudinal or survival data analysis. However, no single monograph or text dedicated to this type of models seems to be available. The purpose in writing this book, therefore, is to provide an overview of the theory and application of joint models for longitudinal and survival data. In the literature two main frameworks have been proposed, namely the random effects joint model that uses latent variables to capture the associations between the two outcomes (Tsiatis and Davidian, 2004), and the marginal structural joint models based on G estimators (Robins et al., 1999, 2000). In this book we focus in the former. Both subfields of joint modeling, i.e., handling of endogenous time-varying covariates and nonrandom dropout, are equally covered and presented in real datasets"-- Preface -- 1. Introduction -- 1.1.

@article{Andrinopoulou2016,
abstract = {The joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data has recently received much attention. Several extensions of the standard joint model that consists of one longitudinal and one survival outcome have been proposed including the use of different association structures between the longitudinal and the survival outcomes. However, in general, relatively little attention has been given to the selection of the most appropriate functional form to link the two outcomes. In common practice, it is assumed that the underlying value of the longitudinal outcome is associated with the survival outcome. However, it could be that different characteristics of the patients' longitudinal profiles influence the hazard. For example, not only the current value but also the slope or the area under the curve of the longitudinal outcome. The choice of which functional form to use is an important decision that needs to be investigated because it could influence the results. In this paper, we use a Bayesian shrinkage approach in order to determine the most appropriate functional forms. We propose a joint model that includes different association structures of different biomarkers and assume informative priors for the regression coefficients that correspond to the terms of the longitudinal process. Specifically, we assume Bayesian lasso, Bayesian ridge, Bayesian elastic net, and horseshoe. These methods are applied to a dataset consisting of patients with a chronic liver disease, where it is important to investigate which characteristics of the biomarkers have an influence on survival.

abstract = {In longitudinal studies measurements are often collected on different types of outcomes for each subject. These may include several longitudinally measured responses (such as blood values relevant to the medical condition under study) and the time at which an event of particular interest occurs (e.g., death, development of a disease or dropout from the study). These outcomes are often separately analyzed; however, in many instances, a joint modeling approach is either required or may produce a better insight into the mechanisms that underlie the phenomenon under study.

@article{Bird2016,
abstract = {Detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through screening can improve outcomes. However, HCC surveillance remains costly, cumbersome and suboptimal. We tested whether and how serum Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) should be used in HCC surveillance. Record linkage, dedicated pathways for management and AFP data-storage identified i) consecutive highly characterised cases of HCC diagnosed in 2009-14 and ii) a cohort of ongoing HCC-free patients undergoing regular HCC surveillance from 2009. These two well-defined Scottish patient cohorts enabled us to test the utility of AFP surveillance. Of 304 cases of HCC diagnosed over 6 years, 42{\%} (129) were identified by a dedicated HCC surveillance programme. Of these 129, 47{\%} (61) had a detectable lesion first identified by screening ultrasound (US) but 38{\%} (49) were prompted by elevated AFP. Despite pre-HCC diagnosis AFP {\textgreater}20kU/L being associated with poor outcome, 'AFP-detected' tumours were offered potentially curative management as frequently as 'US-detected' HCCs; and had comparable survival. Linearity of serial log10-transformed AFPs in HCC cases and in the screening 'HCC-free' cohort (n = 1509) provided indicators of high-risk AFP behaviour in HCC cases. An algorithm was devised in static mode, then tested dynamically. A case/control series in hepatitis C related disease demonstrated highly significant detection (p{\textless}1.72*10-5) of patients at high risk of developing HCC. These data support the use of AFP in HCC surveillance. We show proof-of-principle that an automated and further refine-able algorithmic interpretation of AFP can identify patients at higher risk of HCC. This approach could provide a cost-effective, user-friendly and much needed addition to US surveillance.},

@article{Tayob2016,
abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has limited treatment options when diagnosed at advanced stages; therefore, early detection is critical to reduce mortality. There is disagreement about the value of $\alpha$-fetoprotein (AFP) in HCC surveillance. We aim to improve the sensitivity of AFP in HCC surveillance by using an algorithm that incorporates screening history to define patient-specific thresholds for positive a screen. Methods: De-identified data from the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) trial, which enrolled 1050 patients with hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who were prospectively followed every 3-months, were analyzed. AFP was assayed at each visit, and ultrasonography was performed every 6-12 months. A panel adjudicated the diagnosis of HCC. A parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) screening algorithm, which incorporates screening history, was compared with a single threshold approach for interpreting AFP results. Results: During a median follow-up of 80 months, 88 patients (48 of 427 with cirrhosis and 40 of 621 with advanced fibrosis) were diagnosed with HCC. PEB improved the sensitivity of AFP for detecting all HCC from 60.4{\%} to 77.1{\%} ({\textless} .0005) in patients with cirrhosis and from 72.5{\%} to 87.5{\%} (P = .0015) in patients with advanced fibrosis, when the false-positive rate among all screenings was set at 10{\%}. PEB algorithm detected HCC 1.7-1.9 years earlier in the cirrhosis group and 1.4-1.7 years earlier in the advanced fibrosis group, compared with single threshold approach. Conclusions: PEB increases the sensitivity of AFP testing and detects HCC earlier among hepatitis C patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. These data should prompt a reevaluation of how AFP is used in combination with ultrasound in HCC surveillance.},
